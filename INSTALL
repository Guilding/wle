Tiny installation guide:

  - copy all .py files in a directory (for example, ~/Dev/WLE)
  - copy then edit sample.wlerc into ~/.wlerc
  - create directories referenced in ~/.wlerc, such as:
       ~/.wle ~/.wle/queue ~/.wle/dbs ~/.wle/templates
  - copy then edit templates/* into ~/.wle/templates
  - call wle.py from your .forward of your .procmailrc (see sample.procmailrc)

You need to have the Python SQLite interface installed.

If you are upgrading from a new version of WLE, please add new
configuration variables into your configuration file. Once WLE has run
for a few days, you can remove the variables marked as obsolete. WLE
will take care of migrating your old data into the new SQLite format.
