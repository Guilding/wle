This is the WLE (White List Email) program, designed to keep unsollicited
mails far from your mailbox.

This is a prerelease: the program works for me, but it is not guaranteed
to work for anyone else. Moreover, there is no express setup nor any
configuration guide.

Have a look at the INSTALL and sample-* files for basic instructions.
